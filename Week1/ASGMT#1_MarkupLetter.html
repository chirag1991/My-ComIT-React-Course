    <br />
    Dear Eileen,<br />
    <br />
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
    Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will
    answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br />
    <br />
    <h2>Starting dates<br /></h2>
    <br />
    We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
    however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
    semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>First semester: 9 September 2016<br /></li>
      <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017<br /></li>
      <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017<br /></li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
    prefer.<br />
    <br />
    You can find more information about
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">important university dates</a> on our
    website.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Subjects of study<br /></h2>
    <br />
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
    facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
    and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas
    you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
    priority:<br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C14H12O3.)<br />
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures
        exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3 × 104.)<br />
      </li>
      <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.<br /></li>
    </ol>

    <br />
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
    including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
    other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br />
    <br />

    <h2>Exotic dance moves<br /></h2>
    <br />
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic
    tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows,
    with definitions:<br />
    <br />
    Polynesian chicken dance<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little known but very influential
    dance dating back as far as 300BC, a &nbsp;&nbsp;whole village would dance
    around in a circle like chickens, to encourage &nbsp;&nbsp;their livestock
    to be "fruitful".<br />
    Icelandic brownian shuffle<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Icelanders developed fire as
    a means of getting warm, they used &nbsp;&nbsp;to practice this dance, which
    involved huddling close together in a circle &nbsp;&nbsp;on the floor, and
    shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very &nbsp;&nbsp;rapid
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movements. One of my fellow students
    used to say that he thought this &nbsp;&nbsp;dance inspired modern styles
    such as Twerking.<br />
    Arctic robot dance<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting example of historic
    misinformation, English explorers in the &nbsp;&nbsp;1960s believed to have
    discovered a new dance style characterized by &nbsp;&nbsp;"robotic", stilted
    movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern &nbsp;&nbsp;Alaska and
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada. Later on however it was
    discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really
    cold.<br />
    <br />
    For more of my research, see my
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">exotic dance research page.</a>
    <br />
    <br />
    Yours sincerely,<br />
    <br />
